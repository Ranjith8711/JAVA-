💻 Java Programming Problems and Concepts
This repository contains a collection of Java programming problems and fundamental concepts, designed to help in understanding various aspects of the language and serves as a comprehensive reference guide.

I. 🔢 Basic Number Operations & Data Types
Number Check: Programs to check properties of numbers (e.g., positive, negative, zero, even, odd).

Accept an Integer: Demonstrates how to take integer input from the user (using Scanner).

Saving Amount: Simple program simulating saving or calculating interest.

Round the Number: Examples of rounding numbers using Math.round() and other utility methods.

Float to Integer: Converting a floating-point number to an integer, demonstrating type casting.

ASCII Values: Program to find the ASCII value of a character and vice versa.

Return Double: Method examples that are designed to return a double type.

Long to HexString: Converting a long value to its hexadecimal string representation using wrapper classes.

II. 🕰 Utility and Logic Problems
NQT Problem: A typical problem often asked in the NQT (National Qualifier Test) or similar competitive exams (e.g., array manipulation, string processing).

TimeConverter: Methods to convert time units (e.g., hours to minutes, seconds to milliseconds).

Password Generator: Program to generate a random, secure password based on specified criteria.

Volume Calculation: Methods to calculate the volume of various geometric shapes (e.g., sphere, cube, cylinder).

III. ⚙️ Flow Control and Memory
Jumping Statements: Examples and usage of break, continue, and return statements in loops and methods.

Memory Allocation in Java: Overview of how memory (Heap, Stack, Method Area) is allocated in Java for different components during runtime.

Memory Allocation in Method: Specifically focusing on how method calls and local variables are managed on the Stack memory.

IV. 🛠 Methods in Java
A. Fundamentals
Math Methods in Java: Usage of common predefined methods from the java.lang.Math class (e.g., sqrt, pow, abs).

User Defined Methods: Creating and implementing custom methods in a class.

Calling Predefined Methods: Examples of invoking methods from standard Java libraries.

Methods Calling in Java: Demonstrating how one method can call another method within the same or a different class.

Methods in Different Ways: Exploring different method structures (e.g., with/without parameters, with/without return values).

B. Instance vs. Static Methods
Instance Method: Methods associated with an object of a class and require an instance to be called.

Calling Instance Method: How to invoke an instance method using an object reference.

Void Instance Methods without Parameter: Simple instance methods that perform an action without taking input or returning a value.

Instance Method without Parameter (Duplicate Entry): Another example/focus on parameter-less instance methods.

Instance Method with Parameter: Instance methods that accept input arguments.

Static Method Cannot Access Instance Variable: Explanation of the rule: static methods belong to the class and cannot directly use non-static (instance) variables.

Static Methods Accessed from Both Static and Non-Static Methods: Demonstrating that static methods can be called from any part of the class, including other static and instance methods.

C. Parameter Passing
Passing Primitive Types: Example of Pass-by-Value for primitive data types (copy of value is passed).

Passing Reference Types: Example of passing object references (copy of the reference is passed).

Type 2 Parameter Passing: Specific scenario demonstrating parameter passing, often related to method overloading or passing complex objects.

Type 2 Reference Method in Java: Advanced example focusing on how references behave when passed to methods.

D. Specialized Methods
Accessor and Mutator Methods: Implementing Getter (Accessor) and Setter (Mutator) methods for controlling access to private instance variables.

Business Logic Method: Methods encapsulating core application logic (e.g., calculation, data processing).

Amount Deposit and Withdraw Check using Method: Practical application of methods for transactional logic with validation checks.

V. 🔒 Access Modifiers
Access Modifiers in Java Public: Demonstrating the public modifier, which allows access from anywhere.

Access Modifier Protected in Java: Demonstrating the protected modifier, which allows access within the same package and by subclasses.

Private Access Modifier in Java: Demonstrating the private modifier, which restricts access to within the defining class only.

Example 2 in Private Access Modifier in Java (Additional Focus): Further examples or use cases for the private modifier.

VI. ⚙️ Command Line Arguments
Command Line Arguments in Java: How to pass and access arguments when running a Java program from the command line (using the main(String[] args) array).

Command Line Argument in Java Using For Each Loop in Java: Iterating over the command line arguments array using the enhanced for loop.

Command Line Argument in Java Use to Calculate Sum of Two Numbers: A practical example using command line arguments for simple arithmetic.
